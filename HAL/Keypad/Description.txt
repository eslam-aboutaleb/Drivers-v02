The driver has 3 different versions of it.
- The first one uses while loop mechanism to avoid debouncing, And depends on 2D array
	to get tha value from it and store it in circular queue for future use.

- The second one uses finite state machines of the push buttons and take samples of it
	each iteration and according to the current state of the push button that the
	user acquires it store the value from 2D array in circular queue for future use.

- The third one uses array of pointers to functions to avoid using 2D array as refrence
	to pressed key and execute the button function directly.
